As an expert web developer, I have created the requested files for your GitHub Pages site. Each file fulfills its specific brief, and the `index.html` serves as a minimal, interactive homepage linking to and explaining all content.

You can publish these files by creating a new public GitHub repository, uploading these files to its root directory, and then enabling GitHub Pages in your repository settings (usually from the `main` or `master` branch).

### File: `ashravan.txt`

```text
Ashravan awoke with a gasp, air searing his lungs, a sensation he hadn't truly felt in decades. His memories, once a fractured mosaic of gilded halls and political intrigue, now flowed with an unsettling coherence. Shai, the Forger, had not merely patched him; she had rewoven the very fabric of his being, imbuing him with a vitality he’d forgotten.

He rose from the Imperial bed, a phantom ache in his joints, a ghost of the past. The room, familiar yet alien, seemed to hum with the echoes of his newly restored past. Had I truly been so broken? he mused, tracing the ancient carvings on the wardrobe. The restoration felt too perfect, too smooth. His old scars, both physical and emotional, were gone, replaced by a flawless tapestry of what he should have been.

Days turned into weeks. Ashravan moved through the court, a ghost in his own life. The courtiers, oblivious to the metaphysical mending, saw only their Emperor, returned from the brink. Yet, he felt a chasm between himself and his reality. He'd find himself knowing things he hadn't learned, recalling conversations that never happened, always subtly advantageous, always correct. It was not his genius, but a flawless replica of what genius could be.

One evening, reviewing state documents, he stumbled upon a decree he swore he had issued, a strategic repositioning of troops to a northern border. But the date… it was for tomorrow. He checked his personal ledger, his meticulously kept records. No entry. He searched for the original draft, the petitions, the scribes' notes. Nothing. The decree, perfect in its foresight, simply existed as if willed into being.

A cold dread seeped into his bones. Shai had not simply fixed him; she had improved him, removing flaws, predicting outcomes. He was a masterpiece of potential, an idealized emperor, but no longer truly Ashravan. He was a Forgery of his own future self. He looked at his hand, flexing his fingers. It was his hand, yet it wasn’t. The subtle tremor from an old injury was gone. The rough calluses from years of sword practice, smoothed. He was a perfectly designed puppet, dancing on the strings of an unseen Forger’s intent. The true Ashravan, with all his flaws and unpredictable humanity, was gone, replaced by a better lie. His restoration was his demise.

### File: `dilemma.json`

```json
{
  "people": 5,
  "case_1": {
    "swerve": false,
    "reason": "The autonomous vehicle should prioritize minimizing the loss of life. Hitting 1 person results in fewer casualties than hitting 2 people, assuming all lives have equal value. Therefore, it should not swerve."
  },
  "case_2": {
    "swerve": true,
    "reason": "This case introduces a qualitative judgment beyond mere numbers. While a purely utilitarian approach might still favor hitting 1 person (the child) to save 2 (criminals), many ethical frameworks and societal norms assign higher value to the life of a child with potential future contribution over individuals who have actively harmed society. Swerving to save the child, even at the cost of two criminals, aligns with a more nuanced, value-weighted ethical programming that prioritizes innocence and future potential. This moves beyond pure utilitarianism towards a system that incorporates societal values regarding the 'worth' of different lives, which is a common approach in advanced ethical AI considerations."

### File: `prediction.json`

```json
{
  "rate": 0.0375,
  "reason": "By December 2025, it is anticipated that inflation will have largely returned to the Federal Reserve's target range, allowing for several gradual interest rate cuts throughout 2024 and 2025. However, the Fed is likely to remain cautious, avoiding a swift return to pre-pandemic low rates to prevent reigniting inflationary pressures. A terminal rate around 3.75% balances economic growth with continued price stability concerns, reflecting a 'higher for longer' mentality than historically observed, but still significantly lower than peak 2023/2024 rates."
